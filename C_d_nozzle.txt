In this project, I carried out a detailed CFD study on compressible flow through a convergent–divergent nozzle, which is commonly used in propulsion systems such as rockets and supersonic jets. The main aim was to see how the flow develops inside the nozzle under different inlet pressures and to check important features like choking at the throat, shock formation, and expansion behavior.

The simulation was done in ANSYS Fluent using a density-based solver, since compressibility effects are very important when the flow reaches transonic and supersonic speeds. Air was taken as an ideal gas, and the nozzle was meshed with higher refinement near the throat and divergent region to properly capture rapid changes in pressure, velocity, and Mach number. The inlet pressure was varied from 1.5 atm up to 40 atm, while the outlet was kept at atmospheric pressure, so that different flow conditions such as underexpanded, ideally expanded, and overexpanded cases could be studied.

From the results, I observed that at lower pressures (around 1.5 atm), the flow stayed mostly subsonic, just reaching Mach 1 at the throat. As the inlet pressure increased to 5–10 atm, the flow became supersonic in the divergent section, and weak shocks started appearing. At even higher pressures (15 atm and 40 atm), the nozzle produced strong supersonic flows (Mach 2–3), with clear shock waves forming inside the divergent part. These results matched well with the expected theoretical trends from gas dynamics.

Overall, this work showed how CFD can capture the detailed flow physics inside a C–D nozzle and provided a good comparison with theory. It also helped in understanding how nozzle performance changes with pressure ratio, which is directly useful for propulsion-related applications.
